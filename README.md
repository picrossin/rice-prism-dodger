### gameplay modifications
- the original prompt for the game specified that the player should navigate through levels of large prisms that move in unsurpising ways. in ***prism dodger+***, the levels contain small prisms, but a small path for the player to navigate. if the prisms were any bigger, they would be too big for the path.
